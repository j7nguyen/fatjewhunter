App to monitor joke thieves (like The Fat Jew) on Twitter (and eventually other social media)

Currently this app is manually configured to monitor certain Twitter accounts for thievery, but soon it will have an administrative panel and/or another feature for inputting accounts or jokes.

Other upcoming improvements:
- messages to original authors of jokes notifying them of theft
- plagiarism detection algorithms
- screenshots of original and thieving posts, automatically posted online
- instagram monitoring (probably using OCR)

Notable limitations:
- currently only detects 100% matching tweet (hence the need for plagiarism detection algorithms / libraries)
- cannot currently search tweets more than 7 days old using Twitter API
- bugs thanks to inexperienced developer

If you're interested in working on this or have ideas for how to improve it, please contact me on twitter at [@vietjew](http://twitter.com/vietjew "Twitter page")
